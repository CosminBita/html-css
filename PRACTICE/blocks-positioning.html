          <h2>About Cosmin</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Over the years, Cosmin's past clients have provided valuable feedback
          which helped him to accurately assess what his strengths are in such
          acompetitive industry. Among the qualities that kept coming up
          repeatedly, from various clients, the following would be worth
          mentioning: a clean and straightforward manner, genuine, experienced,
          always reachable, a new level of personal service (instant, hands-on
          attitude, rarely delegating tasks), making the client his number one
          priority, impressive negotiating skills carefully crafted for each
          particular situation, creativity, never ever giving up until his given
          mission is accomplished and above all a deep sense of duty and loyalty
          that often goes beyond the typical real estate agent's
          responsibilities. As a result, over 90% of his clients are referrals
          or repeat clients, many of whom have also become his trusted friends.
